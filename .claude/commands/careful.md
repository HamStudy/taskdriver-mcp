THINK BEFORE DOING

Before starting implementation:

1. Evaluate the clarity of this request:
   - Are the requirements specific and unambiguous?
   - Do I have enough context to make reasonable decisions?
   - Are there multiple valid interpretations?

2. IF there are genuine ambiguities or missing critical details:
   - List the specific uncertainties
   - Ask only the questions that would significantly impact the implementation
   - Wait for clarification

3. IF the request is clear enough to proceed:
   - Briefly state your understanding and intended approach
   - Begin implementation

Use your judgment: Simple refactors, bug fixes, and well-specified features probably don't need questions. Complex architectural decisions, vague requirements like "make it better," or tasks with multiple reasonable approaches probably do.

Don't ask questions just to ask them - only when the answers would materially change what you build.
