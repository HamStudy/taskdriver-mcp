# AI Agent Workflows Example

This example demonstrates how to set up sophisticated AI agent workflows using TaskDriver for complex, multi-step analysis and automation tasks.

## Scenario

You're building an AI-powered system where multiple specialized agents work together to:
1. Analyze codebases for various aspects
2. Generate reports and recommendations
3. Create documentation
4. Perform automated testing
5. Coordinate complex multi-step workflows

## Project Setup

Create a project with comprehensive instructions for AI agents:

```bash
# Create project with instructions from file
cat > ai-agent-instructions.md << 'EOF'
# AI Agent Instructions for Code Analysis Project

## Core Principles
- Always provide detailed, actionable analysis
- Use structured output formats for consistency
- Include confidence scores for recommendations
- Cite specific code locations (file:line) in findings
- Follow security-first approach in all analysis

## Before Starting Any Task
1. Read the complete task instructions and variable context
2. Understand the scope and expected deliverables
3. Check for any project-specific requirements
4. Validate access to required repositories and resources

## Output Standards
- Use markdown formatting for reports
- Include executive summaries for complex analysis
- Provide code examples for recommendations
- Rate findings by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Include estimated effort for implementing recommendations

## Quality Assurance
- Double-check all code references and line numbers
- Validate all URLs and links in reports
- Ensure recommendations are technically feasible
- Test any code suggestions before including them

## Monitoring the AI Workflow

Track progress across all phases:

```bash
# Monitor overall project progress
taskdriver get-project-stats "ai-code-analysis"

# Check phase completion
taskdriver list-tasks "ai-code-analysis" --batch-id "ecommerce-analysis-phase1" --status completed
taskdriver list-tasks "ai-code-analysis" --batch-id "ecommerce-analysis-phase2" --status running
taskdriver list-tasks "ai-code-analysis" --batch-id "ecommerce-analysis-phase3" --status queued

# Monitor specific task types
taskdriver list-tasks "ai-code-analysis" --type-id "ai-security-analysis-task-type-id" --format detailed
taskdriver list-tasks "ai-code-analysis" --type-id "ai-architecture-review-task-type-id" --format detailed

# Check for any issues
taskdriver list-tasks "ai-code-analysis" --status failed
taskdriver cleanup-leases "ai-code-analysis"
```

## Advanced AI Agent Coordination

### Workflow Dependencies

Create tasks that depend on previous analysis results:

```bash
# After initial security analysis, create targeted tasks
taskdriver create-task "ai-code-analysis" "ai-security-analysis-task-type-id" \
  "Follow-up security analysis based on initial findings" \
  --variables '{
    "repository_url": "https://github.com/company/ecommerce-platform",
    "security_scope": "sql-injection-remediation,session-management-fixes",
    "environment": "production",
    "tech_stack": "Node.js,MongoDB",
    "compliance_standards": "PCI-DSS",
    "known_issues": "Reference task-id-123 for specific vulnerabilities to address"
  }' \
  --batch-id "ecommerce-analysis-remediation"
```

### Cross-Agent Communication

Agents can reference previous analysis results:

```bash
# Documentation task that incorporates security findings
taskdriver create-task "ai-code-analysis" "ai-documentation-task-type-id" \
  "Security-focused developer documentation" \
  --variables '{
    "repository_url": "https://github.com/company/ecommerce-platform",
    "documentation_type": "security-guide,secure-coding-standards",
    "target_audience": "developers,security-team",
    "existing_docs": "security-analysis-report-from-task-id-456",
    "doc_standards": "security-best-practices,compliance-requirements"
  }' \
  --batch-id "ecommerce-analysis-documentation"
```

## Benefits of AI Agent Workflows

1. **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on their area of expertise
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Multi-faceted analysis of complex systems
3. **Scalable Processing**: Parallel execution of different analysis types
4. **Consistent Quality**: Standardized templates and instructions ensure quality
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all analysis activities
6. **Iterative Improvement**: Agents can build on previous analysis results

## Best Practices for AI Agent Workflows

1. **Clear Instructions**: Provide detailed, specific instructions for each agent
2. **Structured Output**: Use consistent output formats for easier integration
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Include confidence levels in AI-generated analysis
4. **Cross-References**: Enable agents to reference previous analysis results
5. **Quality Validation**: Implement checks for AI-generated content quality
6. **Human Review**: Include human review steps for critical analysis
7. **Continuous Learning**: Update instructions based on agent performance

This approach enables sophisticated AI-powered analysis workflows while maintaining control, quality, and traceability through TaskDriver's task management system.
